# Prediction-of-Product-Sales
This project is about a sales prediction for food items sold at various stores

The pairplot visualization showcased a negative correlation between Item_Outlet_Sales and Item_Visibility. This contradicts with the assumption that increased visibility should lead to more sales. However, further investigation and stakeholder engagement is needed to understand this relationship.

The lmplot visualization additionally potrays that small outlets predominantly drive most of the item sales.

In summary, further investigation and engagement with stakeholders is essential inorder to understand the negative correlation between item visibility and outlet sales. Gathering additional information on promotional activities, shelf placement strategies, market trends, and customer preferences is crucial for developing accurate sales predictions. This comprehensive analysis will help stakeholders make informed decisions to optimize sales strategies and maximize revenue.

PREDICTIVE MODELS:
---------------------

We tried to predict the Item_Outlet_Sales based on various predictive models which included a linear regression model and a Random Forest model. 

The linear regression model performed poorly on the test data with a low r2_score of 0.56 which was similar to the r2_score of the training data.This clearly showed that the model is performing consistently and is not overfitting or underfitting but has however generalized well to unseen data. Even with this observation, the r2_score is not too high and therefore we need to improve the predictive performance of that linear regression model.

We also went ahead and tested the predictive performance of the Item_Outlet_Sales using the Random forest model, which accounted for about 57% variation in the y_test using the features in X_test. However,the tuned Forest model achieved a 0.6 r2_score showing a 60% variability in the true y values(y_test) using the features in X_test. 

When we performed a comparison of the Mean_Absolute_Error for both the linear regression model and the tuned Random Forest model,a lower MAE:744.28 is observed for the tuned Random forest model, suggesting a better predictive performance than the linear regression model with an MAE:829.13. This lower MAE for the tuned Random forest model suggests that this model's predictions are closer to the actual Item_Outlet_Sales values on average.

In conclusion, based on the metrics provided for evaluating the linear regression model and the random forest model, the Random Forest model with a lower MAE and a high r2_score indicates that it makes more accurate predictions on average.

FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
-----------------------
The linear regression and the random forest model have not performed satisfactorily on their own. Therefore, itâ€™s worth considering using other ensemble methods that combine multiple models, so as to improve predictive performance.

Even if we go for the Random Forest Model, we still need to continuously evaluate its performance over time so that the model remains effective as data and patterns evolve.
