# Prediction-of-Product-Sales
This project is about a sales prediction for food items sold at various stores

The pairplot visualization showcased a negative correlation between Item_Outlet_Sales and Item_Visibility. This contradicts with the assumption that increased visibility should lead to more sales. However, further investigation and stakeholder engagement is needed to understand this relationship.

To conclude on this data visualization,further investigation and stakeholder engagement is necessary to understand the negative correlation between item visibility and outlet sales.
We also need to gather additional information on how promotional activities are conducted, the shelf placement strategies,market trends and customer preferences so as to develop a valid prediction on the sales.
